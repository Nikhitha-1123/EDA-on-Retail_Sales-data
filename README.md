# 🛍️ Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales

> ✅ Level 1- Task 1

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a retail sales dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights to better understand product performance, sales trends, and customer behavior.

### 📂 Datasets Used
-`retail_sales_dataset.csv`: Contains transaction data (date, item, category, quantity sold, total sales)

-`menu.csv`: Includes item metadata (category, serving size, price, and nutritional info)

### 📊 Key Objectives
* Analyze sales trends over time (Time Series Analysis)
* Understand product-wise and category-wise performance
* Perform customer segmentation and behavior analysis
* Identify seasonal patterns and anomalies
* Visualize findings using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly

### 🧪 Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Plotly
* Jupyter Notebook


### 📈 Sample Visualizations
* Bar Charts for top-selling categories/products
* Line Graphs for monthly/weekly sales
* Heatmaps for correlations and seasonal trends
* Pie Charts for product distribution

### 📌 Insights & Recommendations
* Certain product categories dominate revenue during holiday seasons
* Low-performing items identified for potential discontinuation
* Suggestions for inventory restocking and seasonal promotions


# 📱 Google Play Store App Analysis

> ✅ Level 2- Task 4

This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and sentiment analysis on Google Play Store data.

### 📂 Datasets Used

- `user_reviews.csv`: User reviews with sentiments (positive, negative, neutral)

### 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Explore app categories and trends
- Analyze metrics like rating, installs, price
- Perform sentiment analysis on reviews
- Create interactive visualizations using Plotly

### 🧠 What I Learned
- Data preprocessing and handling real-world datasets
- Exploratory analysis using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Interactive plotting with Plotly
- Sentiment labeling and review analysis
- Gained practical skills in storytelling with data

### 📊 Visuals
All visualizations are included in the Jupyter Notebook, including interactive charts.

### 🚀 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

>✅ Level 2- Task 3

A comprehensive machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using anomaly detection and supervised classification models.


### 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores a real-world credit card dataset and applies both **unsupervised** and **supervised** machine learning techniques to detect fraud. It covers key concepts including anomaly detection, real-time monitoring, and system scalability.



### 🧠 Key Concepts Implemented

- 🔍 **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest for unsupervised outlier detection.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest classifier for supervised prediction.
- ⚙️ **Feature Engineering**: Scaling and transformation of time and amount features.
- 🛰️ **Real-time Monitoring**: Simulated fraud prediction in real-time.
- 📈 **Scalability Planning**: Strategy for handling large-scale production systems.


### 📂 Dataset

-`creditcard.csv`: Contains 284,807 European credit card transactions with anonymized features and labels indicating fraud (1) or legitimate (0)


### 📊 Model Performance

- **Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)**:
  - Precision & Recall compared against true labels
- **Supervised ML (Random Forest)**:
  - Confusion matrix, classification report
  - ROC-AUC: ~0.99



### 🧪 Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for Visualization
- Jupyter Notebook


### 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add XGBoost / Neural Networks for comparison
- Save and deploy model via Flask API
- Stream data using Kafka for true real-time scoring
- Set up dashboard for live fraud alerts
